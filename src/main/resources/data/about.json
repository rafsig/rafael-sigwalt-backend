  "professionalDescription":"A passionate software developer with a Software Development and Network Engineering diploma. I had my first contact with coding, in c++, during my Mechanical Engineering Bachelor. During my internships, I further developed the love for programming trying to automate my daily tasks using VBA. That's when I decided I wanted to go into software development full time and professionalize on the area. Now with 5 years of experience on IT, my main skills are on Java, Spring Boot, SQL and React. But I am always looking for something new and have had contact with a plethora of technologies and laguages. ",
